I want to have the front page to be memorable I searched some personal website galleries and the following links are my choices.
I will need to see if these kinds of animation are within my skill set but "Steve Losh" is my favorite so far.

2.<a href="http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/"></a>
3.<a href="https://www.adamhartwig.co.uk/"></a>
As far as wording I would like my contact information and name to be the first thing seen.
It is very unquie and that will stick in the mind of my veiwer.
